# Starter Kit: Azure

Each directory in this repository is a self-contained terraform project which demonstrates an individual use case of ScaleFT. Each example requires the same basic configuration setup in ScaleFT, described [here](https://www.scaleft.com/docs/setup/initial-configuration/). If you've already set these things up, no need to do it again.

These examples are written using Azure. To use these examples, a current Azure subscription & credentials will be required.
