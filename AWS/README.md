# Starter Kit: AWS

Each directory in this repository is a self-contained terraform project which demonstrates an individual use case of ScaleFT. Each example requires the same basic configuration setup in ScaleFT, described [here](https://www.scaleft.com/docs/setup/initial-configuration/). If you've already set these things up, no need to do it again.

Check out the individual READMEs below to see how:

* [Single CentOS Server](centos-alone/) 
* [Single Ubuntu Server](ubuntu-alone/)
* [Ubuntu Server with Bastion](ubuntu-behind-bastion)

These examples are written using AWS. To use these examples, a current AWS account & credentials will be required.
